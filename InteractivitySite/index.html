        As Richard Gere I was born in Pennsylvania. Some have said my middle name is Tiffany but I am here to tell you that no, it is not, and to defend my legacy as a leading man in great cinema.
        <br>
        <br>
        As I grew as Richard Gere I became an activist, an officer, and a gentleman. In 2010, I critiqued the Iraq War and called President Bush a bad president. This launched my career in political public statements.

    <p> Please, click on my face, a face in interlocution with Modi discussing some of my future political public statements, to grant me an Oscar to further cement my legacy. </p>
