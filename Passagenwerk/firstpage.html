        <p>"Benjamin began The Arcades Project in 1927, a document of the flâneur’s meanderings through the shopping arcades of 19th-century Paris. This document remains shrouded in the mythology of Benjamin’s life and death, which has always been a narrative of almosts: of almost having his thesis accepted and being offered a university job, before he was told that his writing was too dense and dull, only to have another Frankfurt School theorist end up teaching that very thesis a few years after his death; of almost securing a book contract and receiving critical acclaim; of almost making it out of Europe with the US entry visa that was in his pocket the day he died, almost settling on the Upper West Side where his colleagues had established themselves, and fulfilling his dream of strolling along the Hudson River; of almost completing Arcades." <br> - Apoorva Tadepalli</p>
